// Geometry Function Lab
// Part 1, Rectangle
//
// Given the following a rectangle object like the one below, write the following functions:
//
// isSquare - Returns whether the rectangle is a square or not
// area - Returns the area of the rectangle
// perimeter - Returns the perimeter of the rectangle
var rectangle = {
  length: 4,
  width: 4
};

var isSquare = function( length, width ) {
   if (length === width) {
   console.log("It is a square.");
 } else {
   console.log("It's a rectangle.");
 }
};

var area = function (length, width) {
  var result = length * width;
  var message = "The area is " + result;
  console.log (message);
};

var perimeter = function (length, width) {
  var result = 2 * (length + width);
  var message = "The permiter of a rectangle with a length of " + length + " and a width of " + width + " is " + result + ".";
  console.log(message);
};


// JavaScript Bank
// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.
//
// Bank
//
// There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts. The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.
//
// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.
//
// Accounts
//
// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or withdraw from an account to change the balance.
//
// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.
//
// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.
//
// Tips
//
// Don't overthink this. Shorter code is probably the answer.
//
// Bonus
//
// Ensure that the accounts cannot have negative values.
// Write a 'transfer' on the bank that allows you to transfer amounts between two accounts.



// MTA Lab
// Objectives:
//
// Apply your knowledge of Javascript to solve a real world problem.
// Get really good at array manipulation.
// Activity
//
// Create a program that models a simple subway system.
//
// The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the journey and the total number of stops for the trip in the console:
//
// planTrip('N', 'Times Square', '6', '33rd'); // This is only a suggested function name and signature.
//
// // console.log() shows output similar to this:
// // "Your must travel through the following stops on the N line: 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square."
// // "Change at Union Square."
// // "Your journey continues through the following stops: 23rd, 28th, 33rd."
// // "7 stops in total."
// There are 3 subway lines:
// The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
// The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
// The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
// All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points. (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.)
// Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops IN ORDER that they will pass through or change at.
// Hints:
//
// Work out how you would do it on paper first! Then start to explain that process in Javascript.
// Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
// Don't worry about prompting the user for input. Hard code some values to get it working. You can use prompt() later to make it more interactive.
// Consider diagramming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
// The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop. (hint: indexOf())
// Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)
